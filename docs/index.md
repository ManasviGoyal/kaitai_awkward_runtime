# Katai struct awkward runtime

This is a runtime for the [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) compiler that generates code for the [Awkward Array](https://awkward-array.org/) library.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe binary data structures, and the Kaitai Struct compiler generates code in various languages to parse these structures. This project generates C++ code which reads the input data into Awkward Arrays, leveraging the flexibility and performance of the Awkward Array library.
